A cli tool to extract magnet links from horriblesubs

This tool allows you to extract all magnet links asscoiated to a 'shows' page on horriblesubs and print them to the stdout.
Horriblemagnet currently only supports outputting the magnet links for the 1080p version of the magnets. Support for the other resolutions is planned.
